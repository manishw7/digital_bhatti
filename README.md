## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need a local server environment to run a PHP application. We recommend using XAMPP, which includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

- [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/manishw7/digital_bhatti.git](https://github.com/manishw7/digital_bhatti.git)
    ```
2.  **Move to your web server directory:**
    Move the cloned `digital_bhatti` folder into the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation folder (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

3.  **Start your local server:**
    Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

4.  **Set up the database:**
    - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
    - Create a new database. Name it `digital_bhatti_db`.
    - Find the PHP file that handles the database connection (it is named `dbconnect.php`).
    - Update the database name, username, and password to match your local setup.
      (e.g., `db_name = 'digital_bhatti_db'`, `username = 'root'`, `password = ''`).

5.  **Run the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/digital_bhatti/`.

## üìñ Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

- Navigate through the homepage to see the restaurant's offerings.
- Click on menu items to add them to your cart.
- Go to the cart page to review your selections.
- Proceed to checkout to finalize your order.
